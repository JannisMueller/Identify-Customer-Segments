# Identify-Customer-Segments
Unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments in population dataset

In this ongoing project I apply unsupervised learning techniques on demographic and spending data for a sample of German households.

# Specifications
The project includes next to the Jupyter Notebook
- train.py will train a new network on a dataset and save the model as a checkpoint.
- predict.py uses a trained network to predict the class for an input image-
- I also created a files just for the functions and classes relating to the model: dataloader.py, fuctions_train.py, functions_predict.py

# Installation
Clone the repository and open the file in Jupyter Notebook respect.
